Initial changelog entry.

### Added

#### Product & Domain Framing 

- Defined the product vision and map-centric positioning of Nimbus Atlas.
- Established the core meteorological domain model (locations, snapshots, forecasts, alerts, layers) and provider-agnostic contracts.
- Documented high-level API contracts and integration boundaries for external weather and geocoding providers.

#### UX Flows & Design System Foundations 

- Defined five key user journeys (UJ1–UJ5) around current conditions, exploration, search, layers and error/empty handling.
- Closed the SPA navigation model with the map as the primary surface across desktop, tablet and mobile.
- Established the first version of the design system: color/typography/spacing/radius tokens and a catalog of base UI components (TopBar, SidePanel, LayersPanel, LegendBar, buttons, inputs, feedback components, etc.).
- Captured global UX patterns for loading/empty/error, accessibility, responsive breakpoints and motion fundamentals.

#### Phase 3 – Frontend Skeleton & Map Core (code)

- Created the `nimbus-atlas` frontend project using Vite, React and TypeScript, with basic tooling and scripts for development, build and tests.
- Implemented the App Shell with:
  - A top bar (brand placeholder, global search input, settings/action area).
  - A main map area that fills the viewport.
  - A floating side panel placeholder used as the first “details” surface.
- Introduced a minimal router with:
  - Main map route (`/`).
  - Settings route and a generic Not Found view.
- Implemented the initial Map Core (`MapRoot`) using MapLibre GL JS:
  - Map initialization with a sensible default center and zoom.
  - Pan/zoom interactions handled by the map engine.
  - Click events translated into neutral `onMapClick` callbacks carrying coordinates.
  - A demo marker + “selected location” overlay to prove the map ↔ UI event flow.
- Added basic UI state to:
  - Track the currently selected location from map clicks.
  - Toggle the visibility of the layers panel without remounting the map.
- Wired a simple map layout and overlays:
  - Layer toggle button and panel as floating overlays on top of the map.
  - Coordinates/status overlay showing the last selected location.

### Testing

- Set up Vitest and React Testing Library for unit and component tests.
- Added base tests for:
  - App Shell layout (top bar, map area and side panel rendering).
  - MapRoot mounting and `onMapReady` callback execution.
  - MapRoot click handling via simulated events.

### Internal

- Aligned the frontend repository structure with the architecture and phase documents (features-based layout, map-centric core, minimal state layer), preparing the ground for Phase 4 (Weather Domain Integration & Data Contracts).
